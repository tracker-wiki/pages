## Blade Shapes

### List of Shapes
* Clip
* Drop
* Spear
* Tanto
* Skinner

### Clip
* Usually a fairly thick blade all the way to the tip
* Use the tip for fine detail work
* __Best for survival__

### Drop
* Usually a fairly thick blade all the way to the tip
* Use the tip for fine detail work
* __Best for survival__

### Spear
* Weaker in the tip
* Tip is bad for fine tuning work

### Tanto
* Fighting/utility knife
* No rounded edge makes for clean slicing

### Skinner
* Very round and upswept blade
* Bad for carving

## Tang Types
The tang on a knife is the part of the blade that extends into the handle.

### List of Tang Types
In order from strongest to weakest:
* Full
* Partial
* Bolt
* Hollow

### Full Tang
The steel of the blade runs the width and length of the handle

### Partial Tang
The steel of the blade runs almost as wide and long as the handle

### Bolt Tang
A thin and usually weak length of steel runs inside the handle

### Hollow Tang
The steel of the blade ends near the place where it joins with the handle. Typical of decorative knives and is impractical.

## Blade Geometries
Different ways of sharpening blade edges when considering a cross-cut of the blade

### List of Blade Geometries
In order from strongest to weakest:
* Blunt
* Tapered
* Hollow Ground

### Blunt
Very strong but hard to maintain the edge

### Tapered
Better for fine tuning and semi-strong

### Hollow Ground
Very fine and sharp but weaker than others

## Handle Types
Different ways to produce knife handles

### List of Handle Types
* Scales
* Molded
* Stacked washers
* Antler

### Scales
Synthetic or natural and covering both sides of tang

### Molded
Plastic or rubber set around tang

### Stacked Washers
Useful for bolt tangs

### Antler
Showy and useful for light use

## Steel
Carbon or stainless steel

### Carbon Steel
* used in tools
* flexible
* easy to sharpen
* holds edge
* rusts easily

#### Carbon Steel Designations
* A2
* D2

### Stainless Steel
* very hard
* brittle
* hard to sharpen
* loses edge
* resistant to rust
* expensive for quality

#### Stainless Steel Designations
* 440A
* 420

## An Ideal Survival Knife
* Full tang
* 2.5" to 5" blade length
* Clip or drop blade type
* Tapered or semi hollow ground blade geometry
* High-carbon steel

## TODO
* Add images of blade shapes
* Add images of tang types
* Add images of blade geometries
* Add image of ideal survival knife
