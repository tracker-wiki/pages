## TODO
* Add images of blade shapes
* Add images of tang types
* Add images of blade geometries
* Add image of ideal survival knife
* Add cross cut image of blade sharpening

## Knife Safety
* Never point cutting edge towards yourself or others
* 'Blood Bubble' -- the area around you when holding the blade at arms length. Stay out unless wielding the knife.
* Be aware of what's around you while cutting
* Keep knives sheathed unless in use
* __A sharp knife is a safe knife__

## Blade Shapes

### List of Shapes
* Clip
* Drop
* Spear
* Tanto
* Skinner

### Clip
* Usually a fairly thick blade all the way to the tip
* Use the tip for fine detail work
* __Best for survival__

### Drop
* Usually a fairly thick blade all the way to the tip
* Use the tip for fine detail work
* __Best for survival__

### Spear
* Weaker in the tip
* Tip is bad for fine tuning work

### Tanto
* Fighting/utility knife
* No rounded edge makes for clean slicing

### Skinner
* Very round and upswept blade
* Bad for carving

## Tang Types
The tang on a knife is the part of the blade that extends into the handle.

### List of Tang Types
In order from strongest to weakest:
* Full
* Partial
* Bolt
* Hollow

### Full Tang
The steel of the blade runs the width and length of the handle

### Partial Tang
The steel of the blade runs almost as wide and long as the handle

### Bolt Tang
A thin and usually weak length of steel runs inside the handle

### Hollow Tang
The steel of the blade ends near the place where it joins with the handle. Typical of decorative knives and is impractical.

## Blade Geometries
Different ways of sharpening blade edges when considering a cross-cut of the blade

### List of Blade Geometries
In order from strongest to weakest:
* Blunt
* Tapered
* Hollow Ground

### Blunt
Very strong but hard to maintain the edge

### Tapered
Better for fine tuning and semi-strong

### Hollow Ground
Very fine and sharp but weaker than others

## Handle Types
Different ways to produce knife handles

### List of Handle Types
* Scales
* Molded
* Stacked washers
* Antler

### Scales
Synthetic or natural and covering both sides of tang

### Molded
Plastic or rubber set around tang

### Stacked Washers
Useful for bolt tangs

### Antler
Showy and useful for light use

## Steel
Carbon or stainless steel

### Carbon Steel
* used in tools
* flexible
* easy to sharpen
* holds edge
* rusts easily

#### Carbon Steel Designations
* A2
* D2

### Stainless Steel
* very hard
* brittle
* hard to sharpen
* loses edge
* resistant to rust
* expensive for quality

#### Stainless Steel Designations
* 440A
* 420

### Damascus Steel
A mixture of high and low carbon steel layered through folding and welding. Higher carbon steel is harder so as small layers are removed you are left with an ultra-fine/sharp high-carbon blade edge. This is a similar process to the art of making samurai swords where the main difference is in the folding technique.

## An Ideal Survival Knife
* Full tang
* 2.5" to 5" blade length
* Clip or drop blade type
* Tapered or semi hollow ground blade geometry
* High-carbon steel

## Knife Sharpening
Knives typically come somewhat dull out of the box. This means you'll apply more pressure, have less control, and are prone to injury.

The general idea is to slide blade along the sharpening stone removing steel from both sides and making it steep. Start w/ a 25 degree angle and finish with a 30 degree angle. Create a burr on one side and alternate back and forth with finer and finer stones to straighten out the blade.

Blades can be sharpened dry or wet depending on the preference, necessity, and material.
